# 🔷 Horizon Core

> **Offline‑first, API‑based blockchain validator and license manager.**  
> Built with **Go**, **PostgreSQL (Core) + SQLite (Offline Cache)**, **Merkle trees**, and **ECDSA signatures**.

Horizon is a sovereign, security‑hardened platform that powers a volume‑based prepaid API model using provable Merkle trees.  
It operates fully **offline‑first**, meaning all transactions are cached locally and automatically synced to the core engine when connectivity is restored.
